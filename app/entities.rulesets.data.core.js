Most of your actions will relate to attacking, defending, or positioning which all frequently require skill checks.

Generally speaking, if an action requires a check, then it is likely an engagement action and if an action only requires a passive check or no check at all, then it is likely a setup action. Engagement actions are further divided into initiations and reactions and you will most often take one of each.

In the case of small scale combat, a round will usually take about five to ten seconds, whereas in something like a social encounter, a round may take twenty minutes or an hour or even longer. Rounds are made up of two phases: the setup phase and the engagement phase. During the setup phase, creatures will have two setup actions that they can use to prepare themselves for the engagements that are to come. This phase will begin with everyone either declaring their current focus or spending a setup action to take the focus action, starting with the Game Master. If you already have focus on a creature, object, or location, you do not need to take the focus action again to maintain that focus, however, you can only maintain focus on one creature, object, or location at a time. You can also only focus a target if it is within line of sight and you immediately lose focus on your target once it is no longer in line of sight. Once everyone has declared their focus, then everyone is given the opportunity to use their remaining setup actions.\n\nAfter the setup phase ends, the first moment of the engagement phase begins. During the engagement phase, you will have two engagement actions which you can use to attempt to overcome the obstacles you have focused. You may take additional setup actions during the engagement phase as part of your engagement actions, however, each one of these setup actions inflicts a -1d penalty on both of your engagement actions. This penalty is applied even if you did not use either of your two setup actions in the setup phase. You may sacrifice one of your engagement actions to prevent these penalties from being applied to your other engagement action.
